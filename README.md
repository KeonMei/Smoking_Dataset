# Smoking_Dataset
This repository contains a CSV dataset related to Smoking. 
The dataset can be used for data analysis, machine learning, visualization, etc.

This dataset was used to perform a statistical analysis to test hypotheses about smoking rates between men and women. Specifically, it was employed to investigate the following:

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The proportion of smokers among men is equal to that among women (p_men = p_women), i.e., smoking rates are the same for both genders.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The proportion of smokers among men is greater than that among women (p_men > p_women), i.e., men smoke more frequently than women.  

A **one-tailed test** was conducted using this dataset to determine whether the smoking rate is indeed higher among men than among women.
